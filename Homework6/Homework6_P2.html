        <h2>The data from the US census that I chose to use was looking at the length of commute for people in Massachusetts. The dataset was split up by county, and had a column for a range of commute times: "less than five minutes", "five to nine minutes", "ten to fourteen minutes", and so on. In Part 1 of Homework 6, I looked at the percentage of MA workers with a commute of less than five minutes; for this assignment, I chose to look at the ratio of those with a commute of five to nine minutes. I joined the vector of MA counties to the cleaned CSV dataset using the state FIPS code and the geographic ID for each county. The fraction of the total number of workers with a commute of five-to-nine minutes is displayed for each county.</h2>
