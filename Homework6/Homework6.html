        <h2>The data from the US census that I chose to use was looking at the length of commute for people in Massachusetts. The dataset was split up by county, and had a column for a range of commute times: "less than five minutes", "five to nine minutes", "ten to fourteen minutes", and so on. I chose to look at what percentage of each county had a commute of less than five minutes, dividing the number of people who had a commute less than five minutes by the total number of people in each county. I then joined the vector of MA counties to the cleaned CSV dataset using the state FIPS code and the geographic ID for each county. The percentage of people with a commute shorter than five minutes is displayed for each county.</h2>
