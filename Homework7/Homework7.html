        <h4>For Homework 7, I decided to look at air quality data within the state of Massachusetts and create a proportional aspect with the size of airports in the state. I downloaded a shapefile of airport locations from the mass.gov website, which has files of all Massachusetts GIS data, and created a proprotional symbol based off of the number of runways at the airport. I would've preferred to size the points by how many flights take off per day, but wasn't able to find data for that. The largest airport by far in the state was Logan airport in Boston, but I was impressed to see how many smaller private and public airports were scattered across the state. For the chloropleth, I color-coded the counties based on how many days in 2022 they had high levels of PM2.5. I chose to look at air quality and airports because I'm interested in studying atmospheric science in the future, and because PM2.5 is a common result of anthropogenic emissions, which can become particularly dangerous in densely populated urban areas where cars and airplanes are common.</h4>
